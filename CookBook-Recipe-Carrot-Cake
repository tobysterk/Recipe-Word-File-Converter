  7/28: no nuts, 50 min-ish bake in 9x5 loaf pan
ingredients: |
  2 c flour
  3 c grated carrots (1 lb)
  2 c sugar (for this I reduced it to 3/4 cup white and 3/4 cup brown)
  1.25 c oil
  2 tsp cinnamon (I added more than 2 tsp. though cause I prefer a strong cinnamon flavour)
  1 tsp salt
  1 tsp baking soda
  4 eggs
  1 c nuts (I used roasted walnuts)
directions: |
  Peel then finely grate the carrots. Since carrots will release a lot of moisture when baked, squeeze some of the juice out.
  Mix the dry ingredients (flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and nuts). Aside from cinnamon, I also added a dash of nutmeg.
  In a separate bowl, mix the wet ingredients (oil and sugar). Beat in the eggs, one at a time, into the wet mixture.*
  *So I didn't exactly follow this step after doing it for the first time. When I followed it, I had a film of oil on top of the wet mixture. Not sure how that affects the cake since it tasted fine anyway but after the first attempt, I followed Claire from Bon Appetit's method wherein she beat the eggs and sugars until pale and ribbony then slowly streamed in oil. This no longer led to me having a film of oil on top.
  Mix in the carrots. Gradually mix in the dry mixture into the wet.
  Pour onto a greased and floured pan then bake at 350 degrees for 30 mins. or until a toothpick comes out clean.
